# Known Bugs

# System Requirements
The modern fork WinPenguins runs under Windows 10 & 11, this version will also run under Windows 7, will very likely run on windows 8, and possibly run on Vista (I can't test Vista or 8 as I only have Windows 7) For Windows XP or older, use the original version of WinPenguins, availible [here](https://winpenguins.sourceforge.io/)

## Usage

* Position the cursor or a window over a penguin to explode it. (will make an option to disable this sometime)
* Position the cursor over balloons to pop them and cause the penguin to tumble! 
* Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to change the direction of Skateboarder Penguins.
* WinPenguins creates a penguin icon in the Taskbar Notification Area (located at the right end of the Windows Taskbar).  
   - Left click to access Settings.
   - To shutdown WinPenguins, right click to open the menu and click Exit.
   - To take a screenshot, right click to open the menu and click Screenshot...
